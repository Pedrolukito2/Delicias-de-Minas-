    <font size="3" face="arial">There is no "top" to the World-Wide Web. You can look at it from many points of view. If you have no other bias, here are some ways of looking for information.</font>
<p>
    <font size="4" face="arial"><b>by Subject</b></font>
</p>
    <font size="3" face="arial"> A classification by subject of interest. Incomplete but easiest to use.</font>
<p>
    <font size="4" face="arial"><b>by Type</b></font>
</p>
    <font size="3" face="arial"> Looking by type of service (access protocol, etc) may allow to find things if you know what you are looking for.</font>
<p>
    <font size="3" face="arial">If you have to use a "top" node, we recommend either this node or the subject list. See also: About the W3 project.</font>
